## Quantum DVR Package

### Overview
A Go library for quantum mechanical calculations using Discrete Variable Representation (DVR) methods.
Overview This package provides tools for solving quantum mechanical problems using DVR basis sets. It supports various operators including kinetic energy, momentum, and Hamiltonians with efficient matrix diagonalization.

### DVR Grid System:

- Operator Interfaces:- Unified interface for quantum operators
- Diagonalization :- Efficient eigenvalue/eigenvector computation
- Kinetic Energy  :- Multiple representations (DVR, canonical)
- Momentum        :- Momentum space calculations
- Hamiltonian     :- Build full quantum Hamiltonians
